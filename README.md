> **Stop juggling multiple apps.** GigLedger is a self-hosted finance dashboard built for freelancers, contractors, and gig workers who want a clear picture of income, expenses, invoices, projects, and quarterly tax obligations — all in one place, without the complexity of full accounting software.

## ✨ Why GigLedger?

Freelancers have unique financial challenges that personal finance apps don't solve and accounting software overcomplicates. GigLedger fills that gap with three core questions answered at a glance:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| **How much can I safely spend?** | **Safe to Spend** = Bank Balance − Tax Obligation |
| **What do I owe this quarter?** | **Quarterly Tax Estimator** = Net Income × Tax Rate |
| **How long can I survive?** | **Runway Calculator** = Balance ÷ Avg Monthly Expenses |

No more setting aside random percentages. No more spreadsheet gymnastics. Just clarity.

## 🧠 Core Algorithms

### 1. Safe to Spend
```
Safe Balance = Bank Balance − Total Tax Obligation
```
Your bank balance minus every dollar you already owe in taxes this year. This is the number you can actually spend without getting into trouble. The tax obligation is computed quarterly: for each quarter, if your net income (income minus deductible expenses) is positive, you owe `net income × tax rate`.

### 2. Quarterly Tax Estimator
```
Quarterly Net Income = Income − Deductible Expenses
Estimated Tax = max(0, Quarterly Net Income × Tax Rate)
```
Only expenses marked as **tax-deductible** reduce your taxable income. The app calculates this automatically per quarter and shows the real-time impact on every transaction. When an invoice is marked as paid, the tax portion is automatically set aside as a separate "Tax Reserve" expense transaction.

### 3. Runway Calculator
```
Runway (months) = Current Balance ÷ Average Monthly Expenses (last 3 months)
```
Tells you how many months you can survive at your current spending rate. Color-coded for instant awareness: green for 6+ months, yellow for 3-6 months, red for under 3 months.

### 4. Auto Tax Reserve (New)
```
When invoice is paid:
  → Income transaction: +invoice.total
  → Tax reserve transaction: -invoice.tax_amount
```
When you mark an invoice as paid, GigLedger automatically creates two transactions: the income you received (the full invoice total including tax), and a tax reserve expense (the tax portion) that sets aside what you owe. This ensures your "Safe to Spend" accurately reflects that the tax money is already spoken for. If you revert an invoice back to "Sent", both auto-posted transactions are removed.

## 📦 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip

### Installation

> **Important:** the application package is named `freelancecash` and uses
> relative imports, so the project folder **must** be named `freelancecash`.
> Clone directly into that folder name (as shown below).

```bash
# Clone the repository into a folder named "freelancecash"
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gigledger.git freelancecash
cd freelancecash

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app — run.py imports the package as "freelancecash",
# so launch it from the PARENT directory:
cd ..
python -m freelancecash.run
# (or, equivalently, from inside the folder: python run.py
#  as long as the parent directory is on PYTHONPATH)
```

The app starts at **http://localhost:3030**

> **Already cloned into a differently-named folder** (e.g. `GigLedger`)?
> Create a symlink so the package resolves, then run as above:
> ```bash
> ln -s "$(pwd)" ../freelancecash
> ```

> **Optional:** set a persistent `SECRET_KEY` so login sessions survive restarts
> (otherwise an ephemeral key is generated each launch):
> ```bash
> export SECRET_KEY="your-random-secret"
> ```

### Demo Account

Log in instantly with pre-loaded data:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Email** | `demo@freelancecash.com` |
| **Password** | `demo1234` |

The demo account includes a complete freelancer workspace:
- **~55 transactions** across 6 months (income, deductible expenses, non-deductible expenses, auto-posted invoice payments, and tax reserve entries)
- **8 clients** with full contact info
- **7 projects** in various states (active, completed, on hold)
- **8 invoices** (4 paid with auto-posted income + tax reserve, 2 sent, 1 draft, 1 overdue)
- **5 savings goals** with progress tracking
- **7 recurring transactions** (monthly subscriptions and yearly renewals)
- All invoices include proper tax calculations at the 30% rate

## 🔄 Invoice → Transaction Flow

Understanding how invoices and transactions work together:

```
Create Invoice (Draft)
       ↓
Mark as Sent
       ↓
Mark as Paid ──────────────────────┐
       ↓                           ↓
  Auto-create:              Auto-create:
  ✓ Income transaction      ✓ Income transaction (+total)
  (old behavior)            ✓ Tax Reserve expense (-tax_amount)
                                    ↓
                            Both linked via invoice_id
                                    ↓
                     "Safe to Spend" correctly accounts
                     for the tax portion being reserved
```

When an invoice is **un-paid** (reverted to Sent), **both** auto-posted transactions are automatically removed. When an invoice is **deleted**, all linked transactions are also removed. This keeps your books clean and consistent.
